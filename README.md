# Vehicle-Registration
 
This task/report gives the opportunity to demonstrate my skills and initiative. The task involves investigate a CSV file called Task_data.csv. The CSV contains a spreadsheet containing a list of information about vehicles registered in Northern Ireland from March 2020 to March 2021. It has three columns.

Column 1 contains the vehicle registration number (VRN) of the vehicle. Column 2 gives the vehicleâ€™s fuel type. Column 3 has the date the vehicle was first registered (i.e. the date when the vehicle was bought and first legally allowed to be driven on the road).Northern Irish VRNs contains more information than meets the eye. Some of the letters in the VRN contain an indication of the area within Northern Ireland where the vehicle was registered.
